AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot generated the sort_dicts_by_key() function almost instantly with minimal input. The Copilot version uses .get() instead of directly accessing the key, offering improved fault tolerance when the key might not exist. This prevents runtime errors by returning a default value (e.g., 0) during sorting.

The manual version, sort_dict_list(), includes a conditional check to ensure the key exists in the first dictionary before proceeding, which is a safer approach in structured data. However, it’s slightly more verbose.

In terms of efficiency, both implementations rely on Python’s built-in sorted() function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). Therefore, performance is virtually identical for small to medium datasets.

The AI-suggested code is cleaner and quicker to produce, especially useful in prototyping or boilerplate tasks. However, it lacks robust validation logic unless explicitly instructed, which can lead to subtle bugs in production.
